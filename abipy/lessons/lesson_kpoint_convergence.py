K-point convergence study for a semi-conductor
===============================================

Background
----------

This lesson deals with the basic k-point convergence study that is needed in any DFT calculation in periodic systems. 
In such systems, indeed, the first Brillouin zone (BZ) needs to be discretized when performing the 
integration of several important quantities e.g. the electronic density or the electronic energy.
Integrals over the BZ are therefore turned into sums over discrete k-points and the k-mesh should 
be dense enough, but at the same time as coarse as possible to make for an efficient calculation. 
Your first investigation into a new compound will often be a k-point convergence study.

It is worth stressing that the density of the k-mesh needed to reach converged results is system-dependent.
Note that metals need much denser k-meshes than semiconductors. 
The presence of the Fermi surface, indeed, introduces discontinuities in the integrand functions and a 
fictitious broadening of the occupation factors (tsmear) should be introduced in order to accelerate 
the convergence of the integrals.

The related Abinit variables
----------------------------

The variables used to specify the k-point sampling are:

    * ngkpt
    * shiftk
    * kptopt (see exercises)

The variables used to specify the occupation scheme in metals are:

    * occopt (see exercises)
    * tsmear (see exercises)

from __future__ import division, print_function

For a more detailed description of the variables, you are invited to consult the abinit documentation. 
The full description, directly from the official abinit docs, is available in ipython with the command:

    .. code-block:: python

        print(lesson.docvar("inputvariable"))


Description of the lesson
-------------------------

When performed manually, a k-point convergence study would require
the preparation of several input files, running abinit for all
the inputs and then extracting and studying the quantity under investigation.
This lesson shows how this process can be facilitated thanks to abipy. 

We will construct a single python object, an abipy flow, that contains all
the information needed for the calculations.
The flow also provides methods for running abinit, inspecting the input and the output
as well tools for analyzing the final results.

Executing the lesson
--------------------

This lesson can be started in ipython by importing it with:

    .. code-block:: python

        from abipy.lessons.lesson_kpoint_convergence import Lesson
        lesson = Lesson()

This `lesson` module gives us all the tools needed for the exercises.
For instance the command:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson

displays this text and can be recalled at any moment. 

The main object we use to connect different calculations is the AbiPy flow. 
The lesson module provides a method that builds and returns a flow to perform k-point convergence studies. 
The flow is constructed with the command:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow = lesson.make_ngkpt_flow()

In this case make_ngkpt_flow builds a flow for silicon since no argument is passed to the function.

Our flow has several useful methods. For instance:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.show_inputs()

displays all the inputs that will be 'passed' to abinit.

To start the calculation inside the python shell, use the following command:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.make_scheduler().start()

The scheduler is a sort of daemon that submits all the tasks that are ready to run.
In our case all the tasks in the flow are independent so the first
cycle of the scheduler will submit all the tasks in the flow. 
More complicated flows may have tasks that can start only when their `parents` are completed.
We will encounter similar flows later on when discussing band structure calculations with AbiPy.

Once the flow is completed, you can analyze the results with

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.analyze(flow)

This call reads the output files, retrieves the data, and produces a matplotlib plot.

Finally, once you have completed this lesson you can exit ipython with:

    .. code-block:: python

        exit

Note that in your working directory there is a new sub-directory (flow_lesson_Si_kpoint_convergence)
containing all the input and output files produced by the flow. 
Have a look at these folders and the files that are in them.
Hint: you can use the `ls` command inside ipython to list files and directories.
You can even open a file directly within ipython with the command: `!vi filename`



Exercises
---------

As an exercise, you can start this lesson again but instead
of performing the convergence study for silicon, you could perform a 
similar analysis for a metal. 

Use:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow = lesson.make_ngkpt_flow(structure_file=lesson.abidata.cif_file('al.cif'), metal=True)

to generate a flow for aluminum. 

Be careful however, aluminum is a metal and the default
parameters for occopt and tsmear are for semiconductors. The
keyword argument 'metal' fixes this. (you could also see what
happens if you don't put this flag :-) ) Look at the inputs to
see what has been changed and study the description of these
variables using lesson.docvar.

If you have time left, it is also a good exercise to open the
python file that contains this lesson and study the internal implementation.
You can get a copy of the file with:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.get_local_copy()

Try to find what to change the set of k-point meshes used in the convergence studies.

Next

A logical next lesson would be lesson_ecut_convergence

_commandline_lesson_ = """
For a more detailed description of the variables, you are invited to consult the abinit documentation. 
The full description, directly from the official abinit docs, is available via the shell command:

    .. code-block:: shell

        abidoc.py man inputvariable

that prints the official description of inputvariable.

Description of the lesson
-------------------------

In the generation of this lesson by the python script all the input files have been generated automatically.
The input files have been organized in a workdir "flow_lesson_Si_kpoint_convergence". 
Inside this directory, you'll find a single work, w0, with four tasks, t0-t1-t2-t3. 
Have a look at the input files, run.abi, of the four tasks to see what is different.

You'll see that also the files file and the jobs submission script have been generated. 
In the job scripts you'll see that the jobs are prepared to run just on the front end.

You'll also see that the files file has been created as well.

To perform the k-point convergence study execute, abinit with the four input sets.

Once the calculations are ready, you'll see three important output files.

    * run.out
    * run.log
    * run.err

The main summary of the calculation can be found in the .out file, we'll go there soon :-). The .err file should be
empty. If it's not something went wrong. If something went wrong read the .err. file. The .log file contains extensive
information on you calculation that could help to find out what went wrong in the case of errors. Especially there are
three types of messages that could help

    * COMMENT
    * WARNING
    * ERROR

In case of an error message abinit stopped the execution by itself, because of that error.

Now the .out file. Some interesting keywords to look for:

    * Symmetries
    * Citation for XC functional:
    * ETOT (the total energies during the electronic structure convergence)
    * Eigenvalues
    * Etotal (the total energy of an ionic step)

Obviously there is much more.

Collect the total energies of the four calculations and plot them as a function of the number of k-points in the
calculation.

Alternative to execution of the manual execution the calculations can also be executed using the abipy scheduler.

    .. code-block:: shell

        abirun.py flow_lesson_Si_kpoint_convergence scheduler
