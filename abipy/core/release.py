    The goal of abipy is to create a comprehensive environment for
    interactive and exploratory computing.  To support this goal,
    abipy provides:

    * A set of pythons objects to store the results of the calculations.

    * A set of scripts for performing common tasks such as plotting the results
      of the calculation.
