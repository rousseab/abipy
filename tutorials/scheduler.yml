# Send mail to the specified address (accepts string or list of strings).
# PRO TIP:the scheduler WILL try to send and email after a default time of 24hrs. If you 
#         comment out the mailto address, this will cause the scheduler to terminate, with
#         potentially nefarious effects on your running jobs. If you do not wish to receive
#         emails, a work around is to set the variable REMINDME_S below to something very
#         large (say, 100 days).
