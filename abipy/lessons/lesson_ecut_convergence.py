\033[91m Basis set convergence study and some more on flows, works, and tasks. \033[0m

\033[94m Background\033[0m

This lesson focuses on the convergence study of the completeness of the basis set used. In our case the basis consists
of plane waves. Plane waves are inherently well suited to capture the periodic nature of a crystalline solid. The
sharp features of the wavefunctions near the nucleus is however more problematic for plane waves. Describing these
features would require very high frequency plane waves. In practice we will always use pseudo-potentials in stead of
the actual ....

Needless to say a different pseudo potential will require a different cutoff for the calculation to be converged. In
general normconserving pseudos require a larger cut-off that ultra-soft pseudos and Projector Augmented Wave 'pseudos'
require even smaller cutoffs. Moreover two pseudo's of the same type for the same element may requier different cutoffs
as well. 'Harder' (having a smaller radius of the region in which the pseudization takes place) require larger cutoffs
than 'softer' pseudo's. There are however many more properties of a pseudo tha determine the cutoff needed.

Start this lessen by importing it in a new namespace

\033[92m In []:\033[0m from abipy.lessons import lesson_base1 as lesson

As always you can reread this lessons text using the command:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m lesson.help()

To build the flow:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow = lesson.make_ecut_flow()

To print the input files

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow.show_inputs()

In this lesson we take a closer look at the structure of a Flow. In general a flow is a container that contains 'works'.
Works are (connected) series of abinit executions we call tasks. To show the works contained in a flow use the command:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow.works()

to show the status of a flow:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow.show_status()

There are many more properties and methods of a flow than may also come in handy. By typing [tab] in ipython after the
period, you will be presented with all the option. Feel free to experiment a bit at this point. By adding a question-
mark to the method or property ipython will show the information and description of it:

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow.open_files?

Will explain what this method is supposed to do.

Start the flow with the scheduler and wait for completion.

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow.make_scheduler().start()

To analyze the results.

\033[92m In []:\033[0m flow.analyze()
