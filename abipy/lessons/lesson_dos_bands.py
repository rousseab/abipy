The calculation of the density of states and the bandstructure
==============================================================

Background
----------

This lesson focuses on the calculation of density of states (DOSes) and 
of electronic band structures within the Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism. 

In contrast to the total energy and its derivatives, the energies of the KS levels have no physical meaning,
except for the highest occupied state that actually would be the first ionization energy if the DFT XC functional would be
exact. So why do we use the KS formalism to calculate electron DOSes and band structures? 

As a matter of fact, the KS energy spectrum is usually in qualitative agreement with experiments (let's ignore correlated systems).
Standard KS band structures with LDA or GGA are relatively cheap and KS calculations allow us to make reasonable predictions 
and to study trends.
In `lesson_g0w0.py`, we discuss a more accurate and expensive approach for the calculation of band structures and band gaps
based on many-body perturbation theory.

The related abinit variables
----------------------------

    * kptopt    (negative values if band structures are wanted)
    * kptbounds (the boundaries of the k-path)
    * ndivsm    (number of points used to sample the smallest segment of the k-path)

More info on the input variables and their use can be obtained with the command:

    .. code-block:: python

        print(lesson.docvar("inputvariable"))

that prints the official description of `inputvariable`.


Description of the lesson
-------------------------

The flow used  in this lesson contains, for the first time, dependencies.
This means that some of the tasks in the flow can start only if its `parents` are completed.
We will first perform a self-consistent calculation to obtain a well converged density. 
From this density we then calculate the DOS and the bandstructure in two independent tasks (non-self consistent calculations). 
Note that the DOS is computed on a regular grid of k-points because the DOS requires an integration over the first Brillouin zone.
For the band structure, we use a high symmetry path inside the BZ.

Start this lesson by importing it in a new namespace:

    .. code-block:: python

        from abipy.lessons.lesson_dos_bands import Lesson
        lesson = Lesson()

As usual, you can reread this text using the command:

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson

To build the flow:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow = lesson.make_flow()

To print the input files:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.show_inputs()

To visualize the dependencies in the flow:

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.show_dependencies()

Start the flow with the scheduler and wait for completion.

    .. code-block:: python

        flow.make_scheduler().start()

To analyze the results.

    .. code-block:: python

        lesson.analyze(flow)

Exercises
---------

At this point, you may want to interact more with the underlying python objects
so that you can start to develop your script or your post-processing tools.

Our flow consists of a `BandStructureWork` object that provides many tools for the post-processing.
Use

    .. code-block:: python

            work = flow[0]

to access the band structure work and look at the `plot` methods that 
are available (hint: type work.plot in ipython and press TAB to get a list of methods)

1) Use the `plot_` methods to visualize the convergence of the DOS wrt to the number of k-points.
   Then change the value of the gaussian broadening (`width` parameter).

2) Plot bands and DOS on the same figure.

Remember that, in ipython, one can access the documentation with `work.plot_edoses?`

Next

A logical next lesson would be lesson_g0w0
"""

_commandline_lesson_ = """
The full description, directly from the abinit documentation, is available via the following function:

    .. code-block:: shell

        abidoc.py man inputvariable

This will print the official abinit description of this inputvariable.
